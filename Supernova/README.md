# Supernova

We used three different models - Einstein-de Sitter, Flat $\Gamma$CDM and Arctanh models - to compare the mag data with the $D_L$ data.

`D_L Data` --> All the $D_L$ data files and programs for the three models used.

`mag Data` --> All the mag data files and programs for the three models used.
