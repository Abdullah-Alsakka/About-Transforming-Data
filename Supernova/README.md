# Supernova

To compare the mag data with the $D_L$ data we used three different models - Einstein-de Sitter (E-DS), Flat LCDM (with the cosmological constant and numerical integration) and Arctanh (without the cosmological constant and without numerical integration) models 

`D_L Data` --> All the $D_L$ data files and programs for the three models used. The .csv file is ready for use.

`mag Data` --> All the mag data files and programs for the three models used. The .csv file is ready for use.
