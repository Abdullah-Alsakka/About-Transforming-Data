# Problems with Transforming Data

Presenting data and programs (codes) used preparing a manuscript to be submitted to an astronomy journal.

`Presentation.pdf` --> can be used as a lecture aid for science teachers interested in presenting some of the problems students will encounter if one decides to transform data into another metric or into a form without a metric. This presentation aid can perhaps be used within an "hour" lecture; free to use without any monetary claim by MLS or AA.

`Cancer Cell Growth` --> Data and programs for modeling cancer cell growth. The example data used for this demonstration are from a published lab experiment (molecular biology). This is a straightforward example of the problems created when one transforms a metric to supposedly ease calculations.

`Supernova` --> Data and programs for modeling using supernovae type Ia (SNe Ia) data. Two sets of data are available here. The first are the "gold" SNe Ia data published by the Riess group in 2004, of just under 160 data pairs with standard deviations. The second data set are those of 1701 SNe Ia from Brout et al. 2022. The distance mag data are taken from the set used by Brout and the D_L and expansion factor data are calculated using the equations, 1,2,3,4, listed in section "2.2 Data preparation" of the manuscript.

The calculations of the values of the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) have been corrected to use the sum square errors (SSE) for most situations rather than using chi^2 calculations as commonly done by astronomers (see Riess et al. 1998). It is observed that the BIC test is not really very useful for comparing unrelated models with the SNe Ia data, anyway. Specifically, the BIC values calculated using variants of the Einstein-DeSitter model do not reflect the relative failure of these models compared to models based on the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) approximation, most which appear to better fit the SNe Ia data.
