# Problems with Transforming Data

All the data and programs used for a manuscript to be submitted to an astronomy journal.

`Presentation.pdf` --> can be used as a lecture aid for science teachers interested in presenting some of the problems students will encounter if one decides to transform the data metric. This presentation aid can probably be best used within an "hour" lecture.

`Cancer Cell Growth` --> Data and programs for modeling cancer cell growth. The example data have been published from a lab experiment (molecular biology). This is a straightforward example of the problems created when one transforms a metric to supposedly ease calculations.

`Supernova` --> Data and programs for modeling using supernovae type Ia (SNe Ia) data. Two sets of data are available here. The first are the "gold" SNe Ia data published by the Riess group in 2004, of just under 160 data pairs with standard deviations. The second data set are those if 1701 SNe Ia records from Brout et al. 2022.

The calculations of the values of the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC) have been corrected to use the sum square errors (SSE) rather than incorrectly use of chi^2 values. It is observed that the BIC test is not really very useful for comparing unrelated models, anyway. Specifically, the BIC values calculated using the Einstein-DeSitter model do not reflect the relative failure of this model compared to models based on the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) approximation.
