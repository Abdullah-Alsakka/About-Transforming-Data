# Modeling Signals from Distant Emissions

Presenting data and programs (codes) used to evaluate astronomical data, primarily object emissions, supernova type Ia, and associated redshifts published year 2022. We also use 18 TRGB (Tip of the Red Giant Branch stars) observations, from the Freedman group published year 2019. These data are included in some data sets and also stand-alone. Finally 16 measurements of TRGB emissions from Anand et al. 2022 also included in some data ensembles as stand-alone.

'TRGB' stars, Tip of the Red Giant Branch stars ---> Data and programs for modeling combining both SNe Ia signals (above) and 15 signals from nearby TRGB stars as reported by Anand et al. 2022 Astrophysical Journal, Vol. 932, p. 15.

Every evaluation presents several statistic calculations. First is the typical r^2 correlation which is of only middling use with SNe Ia and TRGB data, since many analyses report r^2 approximately 0.99. Second is the F-test which is a rarely used, statistical test which is very sensitive to correlation without an upper limit and useful across models with different number of free parametters sing large data ensembles. Third is a version of the chi^2 calculation as commonly performed by astronomers (see Riess et al. 1998 AJ Vol. 116 p. 1009-1038) but is an unusual varient. Fourth are calculations of the values of the Bayesian Information Criteria (BIC).  It is observed that the BIC test is not really very useful for comparing unrelated models with the SNe Ia data and really only indicates the number of free parameters in the model. Specifically, the BIC values calculated for the Einstein-DeSitter model variants do not reflect the relative failure of these models compared to models based on the Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) approximation, most which appear when plotted to better fit the SNe Ia data. The F-statistic values increase dramatically with better correlation and more data, this statistic seems best for model evaluation of SNe Ia data and TRGB star emissions.
